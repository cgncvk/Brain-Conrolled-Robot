ThinkGearNET
v1.1
by Brian Peek (http://www.brianpeek.com/)

This is a simple wrapper library around Neurosky's P/Invoke definitions that
allow you to work with the Neurosky MindSet headset a bit more easily.  The
library can be setup to poll asynchronously and raise events when new data
is available, or it can be polled whenever data is required, such as in the
Update method of an XNA application.

Look at the included ThinkGearNETTest application for an example on how to
use the library in a regular Windows application.

If you have questions or issues, please contact me through my site linked
above.  Thanks!
